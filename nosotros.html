            <h3>Agenda 2030</h3>
            <p>The United Nations Agenda 2030 is a global initiative aimed at addressing some 
            of the world's most pressing challenges. Adopted by all UN Member States (193) in 2015, 
            the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have 169 targets to be achieved by the year 
            2030. The tourism industry, nowadays, is an important economic activity for many societies 
            and responsible to provide income to millions of people around the globe.</p>
            <span class="hideText">
                <p>There are many reasons why supporting the UN Agenda 2030 is important. One of them is the interconnectedness
                among them. Progress in one area often depends on progress in others. Reducing poverty (Goal 1) 
                can be closely linked to improving education (Goal 4) and promoting gender equality 
                (Goal 5). Economic prosperity, achieving the SDGs can also create economic opportunities,
                many of the goals, such as those related to clean energy (Goal 7) and sustainable cities
                (Goal 11), can stimulate economic growth and job creation. It's important to note that
                while the 2030 Agenda provides a comprehensive framework, the specific strategies and 
                actions to achieve these goals can vary from country to country based on their unique 
                circumstances and priorities. Supporting the 2030 Agenda is not just a matter of governments;
                Individuals, businesses, and civil society organizations can also contribute to its realization 
                through their actions and initiatives. We at Tagus Tours are closely committed to Goal 4 
                – Quality Education; Goal 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy; Goal 8 – Decent Work and Economic 
                Growth; Goal 11 – Sustainable cities and communities; and Goal 16 – Peace, Justice and Strong 
                Institutions.</p>

            <h3>Human Rights</h3>
            <p>Human rights are fundamental to the well-being, dignity, and equality of every individual 
            in society. They are closely linked to social and economic development. Access to education, 
            healthcare, clean water, and economic opportunities are all considered human rights.</p>
            <span class= "hideText">
                <p>Ensuring these rights can lead to improved living standards and overall development. We believe that they 
                are essential because they form the foundation of a just, equitable, and humane society. 
                Upholding human rights is not just a moral imperative it´s a fundamental aspect of building 
                a better world for all.</p>

            <h3>Responsible tourism</h3>
            <p>Also known as sustainable tourism or eco-tourism, responsible tourism is an approach to travel and tourism 
            that seeks to maximize the positive impact of tourism on destinations while minimizing its negative effects. 
            It is a holistic concept that takes into consideration the economic, social, and environmental aspects of tourism. 
            Sustainable tourism aims to protect natural resources and minimize the environmental impact of tourism activities. 
            This includes efforts to reduce pollution, conserve energy and water, and preserve biodiversity. 
            It seeks to respect and support local cultures and communities. This involves promoting cultural awareness and respect, as well as engaging with and benefiting the local population through tourism-related activities.</p>
            <span class="hideText">
                <p>It should contribute to the economic well-being of local communities and promote fair economic practices. 
                It often involves creating economic opportunities for local businesses and people. Educating tourists about 
                the importance of responsible behavior and environmental conservation is a key aspect of sustainable tourism. 
                This helps raise awareness and encourages tourists to make environmentally and culturally responsible choices. 
                Engaging local communities in decision-making processes related to tourism is important. Their input can help 
                shape tourism policies and initiatives that benefit everyone. 
                Sustainable tourism emphasizes the preservation of natural and cultural heritage sites, ensuring that they remain 
                intact for future generations to enjoy. Managing visitor numbers and promoting off-peak travel can help reduce the 
                negative impacts of overcrowding in popular tourist destinations.
                Implementing sustainable practices, such as waste reduction and responsible resource management, is crucial to reducing 
                the environmental footprint of tourism. 
                Sustainable tourism often involves responsible infrastructure development that supports both tourists and local communities 
                without causing harm to the environment. 
                It looks beyond short-term gains and focuses on long-term benefits for both tourists and host communities.  
                Sustainable tourism is essential for ensuring that the tourism industry can continue to thrive without degrading the natural 
                and cultural assets that attract travelers in the first place. It´s a proactive approach to balance the economic benefits of 
                tourism with the need to protect the environment and respect local cultures. Many destinations around the world have adopted 
                sustainable tourism practices to promote responsible travel and preserve their unique attractions.
